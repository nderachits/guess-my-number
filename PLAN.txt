Voice "Guess My Number" Game - Implementation Plan

OVERVIEW
========
Create a voice chat game for kids that plays "guess my number" like Amazon Alexa.
The game will be web-based using browser speech APIs for a safe, private experience.

CORE FEATURES
=============
- Web Speech API for voice recognition and synthesis
- Random number generation (1-100 range, adjustable)
- Interactive voice responses ("too high", "too low", "correct!")
- Kid-friendly visual interface with microphone button
- Game state management (attempts counter, win/lose conditions)

TECHNOLOGY STACK
================
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for kid-friendly styling with animations
- Vanilla JavaScript for game logic and speech APIs
- Web Speech API (built into modern browsers)

GAME FLOW
=========
1. Welcome message explains the rules
2. Generate random number (1-100)
3. Listen for voice input with visual feedback
4. Provide audio/visual responses to guesses
5. Track attempts and celebrate wins
6. Option to play again

KID-FRIENDLY ELEMENTS
=====================
- Large, colorful buttons and visual cues
- Encouraging voice responses
- Celebration animations for correct guesses
- Clear microphone status indicators

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS
====================
1. Research existing codebase to understand current project structure
2. Set up speech recognition functionality (Web Speech API or similar)
3. Implement text-to-speech for game responses
4. Create game logic for number guessing (random number generation, guess validation)
5. Design conversation flow and responses (too high, too low, correct, etc.)
6. Add kid-friendly UI with visual feedback and microphone controls
7. Implement game state management (start, playing, won, restart)
8. Add error handling for speech recognition issues
9. Test the complete voice interaction flow

TECHNICAL NOTES
===============
- Works entirely in browser without external APIs
- No server required - purely client-side
- Safe and private for kids to use
- Compatible with modern browsers supporting Web Speech API
